👋 Hey, I’m Abdul Vajid M!  
💻 Full Stack Developer | JavaScript & TypeScript  
🚀 Building scalable, high-performance apps that (mostly) work  

I write code, break things, fix them, and repeat the cycle until something amazing comes out. If there’s a bug, I’ll find it—or it’ll find me first. Passionate about **clean architecture, performance optimization, and making the web faster.**  

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me:  
☕ Debugging with coffee in one hand and ChatGPT in another  
🎮 Gaming (because even devs need a break)  
📈 Exploring business & startup trends
