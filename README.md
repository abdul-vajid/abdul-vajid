👋 Hey, I’m Abdul Vajid M!   
💻 Full Stack Developer | JavaScript, TypeScript and Python
🚀 Building scalable, high-performance apps that (mostly) work

I write code, break things, fix them, and repeat the cycle until something amazing comes out. If there’s a bug, I’ll find it—or it’ll find me first. Passionate about:
1. ⚙️ Clean architecture & performance optimization
2. 🚀 Building fast, user-centric web experiences
3. 🧠 Turning startup ideas into working prototypes

When I’m not in the zone, I’m probably:
1. ☕ Debugging with coffee in hand
2. 📊 Exploring SaaS & startup trends
3. 🌍 Researching global markets & digital opportunities

Currently building cool things at an Australian edtech.
